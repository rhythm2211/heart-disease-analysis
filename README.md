# Heart-Disease-Analysis

This endeavor involves a thorough examination of cardiac disease with the goal of learning important insights into its numerous facets. Exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and the use of a Logistic Regression model are some of the important elements that make up the analysis, which achieves astounding accuracy levels of about 89%.


The heart disease dataset was thoroghly examined throughout the EDA phase, enabling a comprehensive comprehension of its underlying patterns, distributions, and probable relationships. The data was presented in a visually appealing and educational way through smart visualizations, such as plots, charts, and graphs, giving a clear depiction of the essential characteristics and patterns relating to heart disease.

The creation of a Logistic Regression model, which acts as an effective forecasting tool, was the project's main focus.
